    <h1>WORK-LIFE BALANCE IS <br />
      BULLSH*T</h1>
    <p>There should be no balance. Life is way more important than work. <br />
    If you are working nearly as much as you're living, then you're f*cked. <br />
    F*ck the work-life balance, embrace work-life imbalance.<br /> Work less, live more.
    That is all...</p></div>
